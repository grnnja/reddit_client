# Client for Reddit #
When I first started this project, the official desktop Reddit client looked dated, many image and video hosting sites were not supported, and it lacked fullsize images like in the mobile experience.
## The problems that I solved: ##
*Authenticating through OAuth
*Retrieving data from Reddit with JSON and the Reddit API
*Displaying different media formats from different sites
*Linking the client and user to Reddit to upvote and downvote posts.
## Architecture ##
